## Shallow water flows

These movies have been obtained from the data (in directory ShallowWater-sata) produced by the program 'flow_sampler.F90' (in the examples of the repository 'flowsampler').

### List of movies

```
adv3_zeta.mp4 : relative vorticity from experiment adv3 (advection constraint only)
advens_zeta.mp4 : relative vorticity from experiment adv2, adv4, adv5 (advection constraint only)
advdif3_zeta.mp4 : relative vorticity from experiment advdif3 (advection and Laplacian dissipation)
advfrc_zeta.mp4 : relative vorticity from experiment advfrc3, advfrc4a, advfrc4b (advection, forcing, Laplacian dissipation, and different levels of nonlinear dissipation: gamma=0, 0.1 and 1)
